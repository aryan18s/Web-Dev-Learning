        <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites
            and web applications that can be accessed over the internet. It encompasses a range of activities, including
            designing the user interface,
            coding functionality, and ensuring optimal performance and user experience. Web development is a dynamic
            field that has evolved significantly
            over the years, driven by technological advancements and changing user expectations.
            <br><br>
            1) Front-end development: also known as client-side development, involves creating the visual
            and interactive elements of a website that users interact with directly. It includes HTML (Hypertext Markup
            Language) for structure,
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
            <br>
            <br>
            2)Back-End Development:
            Back-end development, or server-side development, focuses on the behind-the-scenes aspects of a website,
            including server management, database integration, and application logic. Programming languages like Python,
            Ruby, PHP, Node.js, and frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel are commonly used in back-end
            development.
            <br>
            <br>
            3)Full-Stack Development:
            Full-stack developers have expertise in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to handle all
            aspects
            of building a web application. They can work on both the user interface and the server-side components.
            <br>
            <br>
            4)Web Design:
            Web designers are responsible for creating the visual layout, typography, color schemes, and overall
            aesthetics of a website.
            They work closely with front-end developers to ensure a seamless integration of design and functionality.
            <br>
            <br>
            5)User Experience (UX) Design:
            UX designers focus on enhancing the overall experience of users while interacting with a website or
            application. They consider factors such as ease of navigation,
            intuitive interfaces, and accessibility to ensure a positive user journey.
            <br>
            <br>
            6)Web Technologies and Tools:
            Web developers use a variety of technologies and tools, including text editors or integrated development
            environments (IDEs), version
            control systems (e.g., Git), and libraries/frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) to streamline
            development and enhance efficienc
            <br>
            <br>
            7)Web Hosting and Deployment:
            After development, websites need to be hosted on servers to be accessible to users. Web developers manage
            deployment processes, ensuring
            that the website runs smoothly and efficiently in a live environment.

        <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on
            the World Wide Web. It forms the foundation of every
            web page and is essential for displaying text, images, multimedia, links, and other elements on websites.
            HTML uses a system of tags to define the structure and
            presentation of content, allowing web browsers to render it as a cohesive web page.
            Tags and Elements:
            HTML consists of a set of tags that define different types of elements on a web page. Tags are enclosed in
            angle
            brackets (<>). Elements can be either self-closing, like &lt;img&gt;for images, or they can have opening and
                closing tags, like &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs.Attributes:
                Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are placed
                within theopening tag and consist of a name and a value.
                For example, the &lt;a&gt; tag for links can have an href attribute to specify the URL.
                Document Structure:
                HTML documents are structured using a hierarchy of elements. The root element is typically &lt;html&gt;,
                and
                within it, you have the&lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt; section contains
                metadata, such as the title of the page and links to external resources

                Semantic HTML:
                Semantic HTML refers to using tags that convey the meaning and structure of the content. This aids in
                accessibility and search engine optimization.

                Comments:
                You can add comments to HTML code using the <!-- ... --> syntax. Comments are not displayed on the
                webpage but are useful for developers to annotate code.
        </p>

        <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: What is Javascript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language primarily employed for web development. It
            enables the creation of interactive and dynamic web pages by adding behavior,
            interactivity, and functionality to websites. JavaScript is executed by web browsers and allows developers
            to manipulate HTML and CSS, interact with users, and communicate with servers.
